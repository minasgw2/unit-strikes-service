## Temple of Febe Legendary CM, 07.05.2024

Super smooth and friendly! I told the team that I would keep them in touch for future contents as well (I did Febe Legendary challenge mode). Super happy with the service. Thank you guys once again, yall amazing!   EDIT: forgot to mention that i come from US server and they made it super easy to transfer to EU server, basically guided me thru the whole process. thank you again guys!

I know my stuff. These guys know it more. Legitimately the best 10 man execution I've ever seen. 
Bonus points for the memes, too. 
A+
