## 2. At what days/times are you running?
Usually we run Thursday to Sunday at varying times between 19:30 and 23:30 CET/CEST. Exceptions are possible if those hours don't work, simply ask in [#üöÄrequest-service](https://discord.com/channels/1088746118227165246/1090286727337345084), or via DM.

## 3. How is payment handled?
Payment is done upfront when the run starts. If multiple services are booked across different days, payment can be split per service for any given day. The only exception is if a service is booked a few days in advance; in that case we ask for a 5% deposit. We accept payment mostly in Mystic Coins and Antique Summoning Stones, but other types of payment can also be discussed. Just ask us!

## 4. Do I need to do anything during the sell session?
Depends on the service. Some achievements and clears without achievement require no action. In those cases you can simply /gg once the combat starts. But there are a few achievement that require you to participate in some way. This depends on the specific achievement in question. A detailed explanation for all services is given in [#üìùinstructions](https://discord.com/channels/1088746118227165246/1088748251206930462) and will also be explained briefly before the service starts.

## 5. On what servers are you providing these services?
Services are provided on European servers only. However, depending on the regional pricing from other groups, it might be cheaper if you transfer to EU, buy our service and then transfer back to your region. If you are interested in transfering, check out more details in [#üìùinstructions](https://discord.com/channels/1088746118227165246/1088748251206930462), or ask us via [#üöÄrequest-service](https://discord.com/channels/1088746118227165246/1090286727337345084).
