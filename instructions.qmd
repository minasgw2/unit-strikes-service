# FAQ

1. For what stuff u can request us to do? 
Any achievements related to Strike Missions, including everything from Normal Mode to Challenge Mode and individual achievements.

2. Which days we usually will be running?
Thursday to Sunday at varying times between 19:30 and 23:30 CET/CEST. Exceptions are possible if those hours don't work, simply ask in [#üöÄrequest-service](https://discord.com/channels/1088746118227165246/1090286727337345084)  

3. How can you pay for your order?
Payment is done upfront when the run starts. If multiple services are booked across different days, payment can be split per service for any given day.
We accept payment mostly in mystic coins and antique summoning stones. Other types of payment can be discussed. The only exception is if the service is a few days in the future; in that case we ask for a 5% deposit.

4. Do you have to do anything during the sell session?
Depends on the service. Some achievements and clears without achievement require no action, but a few achievement require to participate in some mechanics. A detailed explanation for all services is given in [#üìùinstructions](https://discord.com/channels/1088746118227165246/1088748251206930462) and will also be explained briefly before the service starts.

5. On what servers are we providing our services?
Services are provided on European servers only. However, depending on the regional pricing from other groups, it might be cheaper if you transfer to EU, buy our service and then transfer back to your region. A detailed explanation will be given if that is necessary.

6. **I am from NA, but Harvest Temple CM services are too expensive! What can I do**?
You can save a good chunk of money by transfering to EU and buying our service. Even with the transfering costs, it is often cheaper than equivalent services on NA. Check the details in [#üìùinstructions](https://discord.com/channels/1088746118227165246/1088748251206930462) or ask us in [#üöÄrequest-service](https://discord.com/channels/1088746118227165246/1090286727337345084) for detailed explanation 

7. How to request a service?
